### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up ADPanel manually instead of using the one-liner installer:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/antonndev/ADPanel.git
cd ADPanel

# Copy the example environment file and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the panel
npm start
```

> **Redis is optional.** ADPanel works out of the box with file-based sessions.
> For production, we recommend enabling Redis — just uncomment `SESSION_STORE=redis`
> and set `REDIS_URL` in your `.env` file. If Redis becomes unavailable at runtime,
> the client automatically reconnects with exponential backoff.
